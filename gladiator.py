EMPEROR: Rise. Rise. Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard. I don't think there's
         ever been a gladiator to match you. As for this young man, he insists
         you are Hector reborn. Or was it Hercules? Why doesn't the hero reveal
         himself and tell us all your real name? You do have a name.

MAXIMUS: My name is Gladiator.

EMPEROR: How dare you show your back to me? Slave! You will remove your helmet
         and tell me your name.

MAXIMUS: My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the armies of the
         north, general of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor,
         Marcus Aurelius, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife,
         and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.

SOLDIER: Arms!""")
